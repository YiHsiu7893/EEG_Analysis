# Classification of Conscious States with EEG Analysis

### 112 Spring - 數位醫學專題研究, NYCU 
We aimed to explore the application of EEG for detecting the sleep state of drivers to prevent accidents, especially focusing on the method of feature extraction. 

We implemented and compared four feature extraction methods using an SVM classifier: standard statistics, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Vector Autoregressive (VAR), and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Additionally, we experimented with various window sizes and lags to determine the optimal parameters for our analysis. 

Our results indicate that the STFT method achieved the highest accuracy, whereas the VAR model had the lowest accuracy.
